Red Black Tree
==============
Implementation of Red black tree algorithms present on GeeksForGeeks.  Here are the algorithms for [insertion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/red-black-tree-set-2-insert/) and [deletion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/red-black-tree-set-3-delete-2/)  Contains insert and delete operations.

It has 2 types of implementations:

### Non-interactive implementation
It contains the simple implementation of Red-black tree with comments for ease of understanding.

### Interactive implementation
It provides a menu with following options:

1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Level order
4. In-order
5. Insert random values
6. Delete random values

It also prints the steps for each operation such as the rotations, recoloring performed. The level order prints the color of the node along with the value of the node and in-order prints the parent of the node.

The 5th and 6th option are for testing the implementation. It also contains functions that checks for Red-Red violation and Black height properties.
